The first order diffraction efficiency of AOM is crucial in determining our dynamic range and its dependency on the VVA tune voltage will also determine the circuit design which maps between arduino output and power correction. By carefully adjusting the AOM positionï¼ŒVVA power, VCO power, VCO tune voltage, we are able to achieve a maximum diffraction efficiency up to ~60%. (At beginning stage we were using a Voltage Controlled Oscillator(VCO) in generating RF signal that feeds into AOM; later on we switched to a function generator) Then we manually change VVA tune and record the corresponding laser power passing through the AOM with a power meter. The incident power is ~0.8mV
