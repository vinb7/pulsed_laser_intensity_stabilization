# Motivation
Many physical processes depend critically on the intensity of the laser, for example, in a Rabi Flopping experiment, the frequency of probability amplitude changing is proportional to the amplitude of the pertubring
electrogmagnetic field, which in many cases corresponds to the intensity of a laser. Therefore, any change in the laser intensity will result in uncontrolled change in the oscillation, giving us inaccurate determination of the PI time, for instance. For laser cooling experiments, we often want a specifict laser intensity to achieve the best cooling effect or to avoid heating up an trapped ion. Therefore, we expect the laser intensity to be what we set in a control computer. However, in practice, many factors could affect laser intensity: thermal fluctuation, mechanical vibration, etc. So the goal of project is to counteract these undesired drifts in laser intensity.

# Goal
Our goal for this project is to build a reliable laser intensity stabilizing device, exploiting PID feedback control, to stabilize a **Bold pulsed** laser. We aim to suppress power flunctuation down to 1% for a pulse width of 5 us.

# Schematics
## Experiment Setup Schematics
<img src="https://github.com/vinb7/pulsed_laser_intensity_stabilization/blob/main/Setup_Schematics.png" width="1000">
We have a 635nm laser first shining into a sequence of optics, where the light is split into two portions. A portion (how large this portion is depends on the [dynamic range](#Acousto-Optics-Modulator-(AOM)) of our setup) of the laser power goes directly into a photodiode and becomes our raw signal - we monitor the change of laser intensity using this signal. The other portion of the laser power goes through an acousto-optic modulator, or AOM, which acts as a diffraction grating and can diffract incident light into different angles. For our setup, we take the first order light as our output, and it is fed back to the Arduino pin A1. This is the signal we want to stabilize. The Arduino then calculates a correction signal, outputting the voltage from pin DAC1, feeding it into a Voltage Variable Attenuator, or VVA, to control how much power the AOM gets by attenuating the pulsed signal from a function generator, which is set to output a 100kHz pulse signal with 50% duty cycle. The more power the AOM gets, the more optical power is distributed to the first order light.

## Circuit
<img src="https://github.com/vinb7/pulsed_laser_intensity_stabilization/blob/main/PLIS Circuit.png" width="1000">
To increase our dynamic range, we want the control voltage going into the VVA to have a large range. The control voltage is generated by the Arduino's DAC, which has a limited range of output: 0.5-2.7V. Hence, we added a non-inverting op-amp with gain 5x to expand its range. Note: a differential op-amp was used in the past. It seemed to work better...

We also added a non-inverting op-amp with gain 7x between the photodiode and the Arduino ADC. In practice, our device should disturb with the experiments minimally, that implies only taking a small portion of laser power to feed into our stabilization loop. Hence, the signal given by the detecting photodiode will be weak and we want to amplify it so the Arduino can resolve the signal better.

## Acousto-Optics Modulator (AOM)

## Voltage Variable Attenuator (VVA)



<img src="https://github.com/vinb7/pulsed_laser_intensity_stabilization/blob/main/AOM_first_order_power_versus_VVA_tune.png" width="1000">
The first order diffraction efficiency of AOM is crucial in determining our dynamic range and its dependency on the VVA tune voltage will also determine the circuit design which maps between arduino output and power correction. By carefully adjusting the AOM position，VVA power, VCO power, VCO tune voltage, we are able to achieve a maximum diffraction efficiency up to ~60% (incident laser power ~0.8mV, first order laser power ~0.5mV). (At beginning stage we were using a Voltage Controlled Oscillator(VCO) in generating RF signal that feeds into AOM; later on we switched to a function generator) Then we manually change VVA tune and record the corresponding laser power passing through the AOM with a power meter. This bell-shape figure indicates that we should not go beyond ~6V VVA tune voltage as the AOM saturates and starts to lose modulation efficiency (also potentially damaging the AOM). It is also worth noting that if the arduino DAC output pushes VVA tune beyond this saturation voltage level, the whole relation will invert and we may observe abnormal behavior. If the maximum received power is still below the setpoint, the falling behavior of AOM first order efficiency will send a false signal to arduino which triggers a even larger error signal that in turn further brings up the VVA tune voltage. This ends up into a loop stuck and maximum arduino DAC output with zero stabilization ability and potentially damages the AOM. We confirmed this prediction by observing spontaneous dropping of received laser power. By using a differential op-amp, we were able to linearly map the arduino DAC output (0.5~2.7 V) to (0~6 V) that perfectly terminates at the saturation point. However due to some external considerations we switched to an op-amp with much higher gain which again causes this problem (DAC automatically slides to 2.7V once it reaches around 1.1V）. Thus one major next step is to add it back and also implement an algorithm for double protection.





## Arduino DUE
<img src="https://github.com/vinb7/pulsed_laser_intensity_stabilization/blob/main/Arduino_DUE.png" width="1000">
Arduino DUE is a common, accessible microcontroller that allows us to read input voltage, output voltage, and calculate corrections using a PID algorithm. Voltage generated from the photodiode taking the stabilized signal is fed into one of its Analog-to-Digital Converter (ADC) pin, and after calculating the PID error signal, a correction voltage is outputted from one of its Digital-to-Analog Converter (DAC) pin to vary the power received by the AOM. <br />
<br />
Arduino DUE is the fastest among the Arduino family, in terms of sampling rate and processing speed. However, it turned out that for our purpose of stabilzing a 5us pulse, the speed of the Arduino DUE is still insufficient. Below is a summary of the time taken by different Arduino commands: <br />
<br />
digitalRead(): 1.2us <br />
read_adc(): 1.8us <br />
micros(): 1.3us <br />
analogWrite(): 3.8us <br />
Serial.println(“ “): 1.3ms <br />
loop(): 25us [nothing is in the loop()] <br />
<br />

read_adc() and analogWrite() take time on the order of the pulse length. So when the pulse length approaches these commands' runtimes, it happens frequently that a read_adc() which we expect to be executed when the pulse is high, actually returns a value (typically 0) when the pulse is low. This greatly compromises our stability because a reading of 0 misleads the Arduino to think that the intensity of the laser has dropped significantly so it needs to increase the power giving to the AOM. The result is a sudden jump on the laser intensity. This has been observed and is mitigated by our Peak Averaging algorithm. <br />
<br />

P.S.: When working with Arduino code (.ino), be mindful that many C++ standard libraries (e.g., std::arr, vector) are not perfectly compatible with Arduino, and the error message may not point this out.
# Feedback Loop
## Short Pulse Sampling
We are currently implementing a peak average algorithm to capture the laser beam intensity and calculate error signal. Essentially we calculate the error signal based on past 100 ADC readings by sorting this array and averaging the leading 10 terms. These two numbers (100, 10) are very conservative choice for now and we have tested them to perform good stabilization. Ideally we hope the sampling window and number of leading terms to be able to self-adjust to different frequency and duty cycle. We have attempted synchronizing arduino ADC sampling with the real laser pulse by either using a Transistor-Transistor Logic(TTL) or directly sending pulse signal synchronized with laser pulse to arduino's digital pin. However due multiple constraints from arduino runtime, we observe distinct phase mismatch between two pulses which basically introduce plenty of unwanted random intermediate and off-pulse voltage level. We also attempted taking max over a smaller sampling window; however, our current test laser and pulsing mechanism displays ~3% fluctuation at microsecond scale. Below is a graph of typical arduino ADC readout:

## Proportional-Integral-Derivative (PID) Controller
<img src="https://github.com/vinb7/pulsed_laser_intensity_stabilization/blob/main/PID_Control.png" width="1000">
After the Arduino successfully samples one ADC reading, it passes that value, called the signal, to our PID controller. First, the signal is compared with a setpoint, which represents the desired intensity level set by the user, and the difference of these two values are multiplied by the k_p coefficient - this gives the proportional (P) correction. The P correction acts like a reaction force - the more deviated the signal is from the setpoint, the stronger the correction is. And the P coefficient gives a measure of how strong the reaction is. A judicious choice of the P coefficient is important, because a large P coefficient will result in oscillation whereas a small P coefficient makes the stabilizating process slow. <br />
<br />
By P correction along, often the intensity cannot get back to the setpoint. This is because when the difference between the setpoint and the signal becomes smaller, the P correction also diminishes, resulting in weaker correcting power. Eventually, the geometric series converges to some fixed value, away from the setpoint. Thus, we introduce the integral (I) correction. The I correction sums all the previous errors (defined as signal - setpoint), and tries to minimize this cumulated error. It is therefore able to detect the aforementioned constant offset and bring the intensity to the wanted value. <br />
<br />
The derivative (D) correction is used as a damping term to suppress overshoots and oscillations. When the P coefficient is too large, the controller tends to overcorrect for an error, which introduces extra noise and could sometimes damage the system. The D correction is proportional to the derivative of the signal, so when the signal is changing too fast, either because of overcorrecting or the signal is truly flunctuating suddenly, the D correction kicks in to slow down these abrupt changes. Below is a plot from the scope that shows how turning on the D term helps calming down the oscillation.

# Results
### Peak Fluctuation
<img src ="https://github.com/vinb7/pulsed_laser_intensity_stabilization/blob/main/peak fluctuation.png" width="1000">
When conducting tests on high frequency pulses, such as a 5us pulse width, we encounter a challenge in stabilizing each peak adequately. This difficulty arises due to the runtime of the Arduino functions and the relatively short pulse widths being tested. 
As a result, we are only able to capture 0 to 2 data points per peak. The plot provided above showcases the fluctuation in laser intensity observed at a few peaks. Notably, we discovered that the peak value itself exhibited a significant fluctuation of approximately 12%. 
This inconsistency highlights the limitations imposed by the testing conditions and emphasizes the need for improved methods to stabilize the peaks in such high frequency pulse experiments.

### One Sampling Window for Arduino
<img src ="https://github.com/vinb7/pulsed_laser_intensity_stabilization/blob/main/one sampling window.png" width="1000">
This plot represents the results of our stabilization efforts for a single sampling window using an Arduino with a 5μs pulse width. In the plot, we observe two distinct peaks: one located at 0V and another centered around 0.53V. However, the intermediate values between these peaks are so sparsely sampled that they are barely discernible on the plot.

Focusing on the distribution associated with the laser being on, specifically the peak around 0.53V, we can calculate the relative error as a measure of the laser's stability. To determine the relative error, we compute the standard deviation of all the measurements within our trial and divide it by the mean value. In this case, the relative error is found to be 4.3%.

It is important to note that this sampling window represents a scenario where we have not yet implemented significant stabilization measures. Therefore, the 4.3% relative error primarily reflects the limitations of our system, including noise from electronic components and constraints imposed by the oscilloscope used for data collection. This relative error serves as a characterization of our system's current capabilities rather than an achievement towards our goal of attaining a 1% relative error for a 5μs pulse width.

However, despite the challenges encountered, this characterization provides valuable insights into the long-term performance of our feedback loop. It highlights the areas where improvements are needed to enhance the stability and precision of our laser system..

<img src ="https://github.com/vinb7/pulsed_laser_intensity_stabilization/blob/main/raw one sampling window.png" width="1000">
The analysis of the raw signal obtained directly from the laser, without passing through any of our electronic components or the acousto-optic modulator (AOM), reveals a relative error of 1.2% over the 100-pulse window. This finding suggests that enhancing our optical alignment and circuit design could potentially reduce the inherent error in our pulsed laser setup, which currently stands at 4.3%.

It is important to note that the raw signal we obtained does not undergo any stabilization feedback loop. In contrast, the pulsed laser signal being evaluated for one sampling window lacks a significant stabilization feedback loop as well. By comparing the performance of these signals at this short time scale with their behavior at a much longer time scale, we can assess the efficacy of our stabilization mechanism.

By conducting such comparisons, we can gain insights into the actual effectiveness of our stabilization process and understand the extent to which it mitigates the fluctuations and instability in the pulsed laser system. This analysis will allow us to evaluate the performance of our stabilization feedback loop and potentially identify areas for further improvement.

### Overnight Trial
<img src ="https://github.com/vinb7/pulsed_laser_intensity_stabilization/blob/main/long_term_performance.png" width="1000">
The histogram presented here illustrates the observed intensity signals of a pulsed laser over a 6-hour overnight trial, focusing on a 5μs pulse width. Throughout this experiment, our stabilization feedback loop operated continuously over this extended time scale, providing substantial adjustments to stabilize the laser intensity.

Upon analyzing the data, we determined that the relative error for this particular experiment was measured at 4.4%. While this value falls short of our desired goal of achieving a 1% relative error for a 5μs pulse width, the relative error obtained aligns closely with the proclaimed inherent error of 4.3% discussed in the previous section!

This finding suggests that our stabilization feedback system performs well when operating over longer time scales. However, it also indicates that further attention should be given to reducing noise within the system. By taking measures to mitigate noise sources and optimize the overall system design, we can potentially enhance the stability of the pulsed laser and further improve the 4.4% relative error.

By acknowledging the nearly equivalent values of the relative error and the proclaimed inherent error, we can gain confidence in the effectiveness of our stabilization feedback system and recognize the importance of addressing noise-related factors to achieve greater precision in our experiments.

<img src ="https://github.com/vinb7/pulsed_laser_intensity_stabilization/blob/main/Screen Shot 2023-06-09 at 8.40.23 AM.png" width = "1000">

In contrast to the stabilization feedback loop's ability to maintain a consistent precision over time, we observe a drift in the precision of the raw signal's intensity. Specifically, the relative error of the raw signal increased from 1.2% to 3.2% over the duration of the experiment. This finding suggests that without the stabilization feedback loop, the precision of the raw signal deteriorates over time.

To improve our inherent error, reducing noise from the electrical components plays a crucial role. By replacing the current breadboards with a printed circuit board (PCB) design, we anticipate a significant reduction in noise and an improvement in the inherent error of our laser system. The PCB design offers better electrical performance, enhanced signal integrity, and reduced interference, which are vital for achieving higher precision.

Additionally, exploring new algorithms for feedback loops that can effectively stabilize the laser system on the nano/microsecond scale holds promise for further improving our results. Such algorithms can take advantage of advanced control techniques and sophisticated signal processing methods to enhance the stability and precision of the pulsed laser system.

By addressing these factors—reducing noise through a PCB design and exploring innovative feedback loop algorithms—we can make significant strides in reducing the inherent error and achieving better precision in our laser system. These improvements will contribute to the overall advancement of our experimental capabilities and enable more accurate and reliable measurements.

### Simulating Practical Fluctuations
Our testing laser does not drift significantly over long time, therefore, to show the effect of our stabilization, we placed a variable filter in front of the laser which blocked a portion of light depending on how much it is rotated. Below are two situations which could happen in practice. <br />

### Adiabatic Fluctuation
<img src="https://github.com/vinb7/pulsed_laser_intensity_stabilization/blob/main/Gradual.png" width="1000">
For this plot, we were changing the filter gradually. The raw signal is changing wildly in amplitude, however, the stabilized signal remains at the setpoint. This shows that the stabilization is taking place. This artificial fluctuation takes 18s to complete, which may seem to be slow, but the speed of this fluctuation is still very large compared to more realistic drifts, so we expect our device to handle slower, more realistic fluctuations just as well.<br />
<br />
At the right end, the stabilized signal is brought up by a larger fluctuation and the stabilization fails. This is because when the raw signal is higher than the setpoint, the Arduino tries to output a low voltage to increase the attenuation of the VVA, so the AOM gets less power and less optical power will be delivered; however, the Arduino output has got to the minimum and it cannot lower the intensity any more. So the stabilized signal is now swinging with the fluctuation. This is what happens when the error is out of the dynamic range. <br />

### Long Deadtime 
<img src="https://github.com/vinb7/pulsed_laser_intensity_stabilization/blob/main/Deadtime.png" width="1000">
This is simulating when people stop running experiments and only come back sometimes later. When no experiment is running, the laser is blocked but is still on and drifting, yet the Arduino receives no information regarding how the laser intensity is changing Then, when people restart the experiment, we expect our device to bring back the free-running laser despite this lack of information. As we see here, the stabilization is able to function even after a period of long deadtime. How long it takes to bring back the optical power depends on the settings of PID coefficients. With our default setting, we typically saw stabilization within 10ms.<br />
<br />

# Future Plan
The top priority is to find a microcontroller with faster sampling rate and shorter processing time. We made the Arduino DUE to work by designing sophisticated algorithm, which sacrifices short-term stability for long-term reliability. Currently, the Arduino is ignorant of fluctuations faster than 100ms, which makes our goal of suppressing the flunctuation down to 1% unreachable. However, if a new microcontroller can keep up with the short pulse length, a more straightforward algorithm can be employed which should make this blind time much shorter and therefore we can address those fast fluctuations. <br />
<br />
Our current setup concerns most about fast iteration, so we used breadboards for circuit. However, breadboard is more susceptible to noise than a printed circuit board, so we should switch to PCB once we are confident with our final circuit design. We should also replace the two exterior DC power supplies with Acopian AC-DC supplies to make the PCB more compact and portable.
