# Motivation
Many physical processes depend critically on the intensity of the laser, for example, in a Rabi Flopping experiment, the frequency of probability amplitude changing is proportional to the amplitude of the pertubring
electrogmagnetic field, which in many cases corresponds to the intensity of a laser. Therefore, any change in the laser intensity will result in uncontrolled change in the oscillation, giving us inaccurate determination of the PI time, for instance. For laser cooling experiments, we often want a specifict laser intensity to achieve the best cooling effect or to avoid heating up an trapped ion. In practice, many factors could affect laser intensity: thermal fluctuation, mechanical vibration, etc. So the goal of project is to counteract these undesired drifts in laser intensity.

# Goal
Our goal for this project is to build a reliable laser intensity stabilizing device, exploiting PID feedback control, to stabilize a pulsed laser. We aim to suppress power flunctuation down to 1% for a pulse width of 5 us.

# Schematics
## Experiment Setup Schematics

We have a 635nm laser first shining into a sequence of optics, where the light is split into two portions. A portion goes directly into a photodiode and becomes our raw signal - we monitor the change of laser intensity using this signal. The other portion of the laser goes through an acousto-optic modulator, or AOM, which acts as a diffraction grating and can diffract incident light into different angles. For our setup, we take the first order light. This first order light will be the output, and be fed back to the Arduino. This is the signal we want to stabilize. The Arduino then calculates a correction signal, feeding it into a Voltage Variable Attenuator, or VVA, to control how much power the AOM gets by attenuating the pulsed signal from a function generator. The more power the AOM gets, the more optical power is distributed to the first order light.

The first order diffraction efficiency of AOM is crucial in determining our dynamic range and its dependency on the VVA tune voltage will also determine the circuit design which maps between arduino output and power correction. By carefully adjusting the AOM positionï¼ŒVVA power, VCO power, VCO tune voltage, we are able to achieve a maximum diffraction efficiency up to ~60%. (At beginning stage we were using a Voltage Controlled Oscillator(VCO) in generating RF signal that feeds into AOM; later on we switched to a function generator) Then we manually change VVA tune and record the corresponding laser power passing through the AOM with a power meter. The incident power is ~0.8mV
